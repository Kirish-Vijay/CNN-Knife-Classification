# CNN-Knife-Classification

The project focuses on developing a deep learning-based system to classify real-world knife images into different categories, addressing the increasing incidents of knife-related crimes. The deep neural network (DNN), based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformers, is trained on a dataset comprising around 9928 knife images in 192 classes, with an additional 351 images for testing. The performance is evaluated using mean Average Precision (mAP). 

The repository includes code, a detailed PDF report covering hyper-parameter exploration, deep model architecture experimentation and evaluation methodology.
